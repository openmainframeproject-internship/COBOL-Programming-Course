# *COBOL Programming Course*
## *Short Project Description*
The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others that will 
follow in your foot steps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the development of this project.

| Folder | Description |
|---|---|
| Documentation |  all documentation the project team has created to describe the architecture, design, installation and configuration of the project |
| Notes and Research | Relevant information useful to understand the tools and techniques used in the project |
| Status Reports | Project management documentation - weekly reports, milestones, etc. |
| src | Source code - create as many subdirectories as needed |
